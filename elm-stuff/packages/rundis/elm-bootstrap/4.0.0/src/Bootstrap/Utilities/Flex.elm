module Bootstrap.Utilities.Flex exposing (..)

{-| Quickly manage the layout, alignment, and sizing of grid columns, navigation, components, and more with a full suite of responsive flexbox utilities. For more complex implementations, custom CSS may be necessary.

# Flex containers

## Block containers
@docs block, blockSm, blockMd, blockLg, blockXl

## Inline containers
@docs inline, inlineSm, inlineMd, inlineLg, inlineXl

## Direction
@docs row, rowSm, rowMd, rowLg, rowXl, rowReverse, rowReverseSm, rowReverseMd, rowReverseLg, rowReverseXl, col, colSm, colMd, colLg, colXl, colReverse, colReverseSm, colReverseMd, colReverseLg, colReverseXl


## Justify content
Use justify-content utilities on flexbox containers to change the alignment of flex items on the main axis (the x-axis to start y-axis if flex-direction: column). Choose from start (browser default)/ end / center / between / or around.
@docs justifyStart, justifyStartSm, justifyStartMd, justifyStartLg, justifyStartXl, justifyEnd, justifyEndSm, justifyEndMd, justifyEndLg, justifyEndXl, justifyCenter, justifyCenterSm, justifyCenterMd, justifyCenterLg, justifyCenterXl, justifyBetween, justifyBetweenSm, justifyBetweenMd, justifyBetweenLg, justifyBetweenXl, justifyAround, justifyAroundSm, justifyAroundMd, justifyAroundLg, justifyAroundXl

## Align items
Use align-items utilities on flexbox containers to change the alignment of flex items on the cross axis (the y-axis to start or x-axis if flex-direction: column). Choose from start / end / center / baseline / or stretch (browser default).
@docs alignItemsStart, alignItemsStartSm, alignItemsStartMd, alignItemsStartLg, alignItemsStartXl, alignItemsEnd, alignItemsEndSm, alignItemsEndMd, alignItemsEndLg, alignItemsEndXl, alignItemsCenter, alignItemsCenterSm, alignItemsCenterMd, alignItemsCenterLg, alignItemsCenterXl, alignItemsBaseline, alignItemsBaselineSm, alignItemsBaselineMd, alignItemsBaselineLg, alignItemsBaselineXl, alignItemsStretch, alignItemsStretchSm, alignItemsStretchMd, alignItemsStretchLg, alignItemsStretchXl

## Wrapping
Change how flex items wrap in a flex container. Choose from no wrapping at all (the browser default) with nowrap / wrap or reverse wrapping.
@docs wrap, wrapSm, wrapMd, wrapLg, wrapXl, wrapReverse, wrapReverseSm, wrapReverseMd, wrapReverseLg, wrapReverseXl, nowrap, nowrapSm, nowrapMd, nowrapLg, nowrapXl


# Item level

## Align self
Use align-self utilities on flexbox items to individually change their alignment on the cross axis (the y-axis to start or x-axis if flex-direction: column). Choose from the same options as align-items: start / end / center / baseline / or stretch (browser default).

@docs alignSelfStart, alignSelfStartSm, alignSelfStartMd, alignSelfStartLg, alignSelfStartXl, alignSelfEnd, alignSelfEndSm, alignSelfEndMd, alignSelfEndLg, alignSelfEndXl, alignSelfCenter, alignSelfCenterSm, alignSelfCenterMd, alignSelfCenterLg, alignSelfCenterXl, alignSelfBaseline, alignSelfBaselineSm, alignSelfBaselineMd, alignSelfBaselineLg, alignSelfBaselineXl, alignSelfStretch, alignSelfStretchSm, alignSelfStretchMd, alignSelfStretchLg, alignSelfStretchXl
